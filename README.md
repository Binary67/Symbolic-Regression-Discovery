# Symbolic-Regression Discovery 
_Evolve algebraic expressions that rediscover hidden equations from data_

## üß© Why This Project?

Physics‚Äîand, really, all the natural sciences‚Äîoften start with **measurements whose underlying relationship is unknown**.  
**Symbolic regression powered by Genetic Programming (GP)** lets you search the space of possible formulas directly, producing human-readable equations instead of black-box coefficients.

In this repo you will:

1. **Generate fully synthetic ‚Äúexperiments.‚Äù**  
2. **Evolve** expression trees using GP (via the DEAP library).  
3. **Rediscover** the true equation (or an equally good surrogate) and quantify its accuracy.
